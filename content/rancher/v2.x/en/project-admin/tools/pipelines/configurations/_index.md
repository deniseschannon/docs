Configuring a pipeline automates the process of triggering and publishing builds. This section describes how to set up a pipeline in a production environment.

- The [Basic Configuration](#basic-configuration) section provides sequential instruction on how to configure a functional pipeline.
- The [Advanced Configuration](#advanced-configuration) section provides instructions for configuring pipeline options.

## Basic Configuration

To configure a functional pipeline for your project, begin by completing the mandatory basic configuration steps.

### Pipeline Configuration Outline

Initial configuration of a pipeline in a production environment involves completion of several mandatory procedures.

>**Note:** Before setting up a pipeline for a production environment, we recommend trying the [Pipeline Quick Start Guide]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/quick-start-guide).

### 1. Configuring Version Control Providers

Begin configuration of your pipeline by enabling authentication with your version control provider. Rancher Pipeline supports integration with GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

Select your provider's tab below and follow the directions.

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "GitHub" %}}
1. From the context menu, open the project for which you're configuring a pipeline.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Pipelines**. In versions prior to v2.2.0, you can select **Resources > Pipelines**.

1. Follow the directions displayed to **Setup a Github application**. Rancher redirects you to Github to setup an OAuth App in Github.

1. From GitHub, copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Paste them into Rancher.

1. If you're using GitHub for enterprise, select **Use a private github enterprise installation**. Enter the host address of your GitHub installation.

1. Click **Authenticate**.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "GitLab" %}}

_Available as of v2.1.0_

1. From the context menu, open the project for which you're configuring a pipeline.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Pipelines**. In versions prior to v2.2.0, you can select **Resources > Pipelines**.

1. Follow the directions displayed to **Setup a GitLab application**. Rancher redirects you to GitLab.

1. From GitLab, copy the **Application ID** and **Secret**. Paste them into Rancher.

1. If you're using GitLab for enterprise setup, select **Use a private gitlab enterprise installation**. Enter the host address of your GitLab installation.

1. Click **Authenticate**.

>**Note:**
> 1. Pipeline uses Gitlab [v4 API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/v3_to_v4.html) and the supported Gitlab version is 9.0+.  
> 2. If you use GitLab 10.7+ and your Rancher setup is in a local network, enable the **Allow requests to the local network from hooks and services** option in GitLab admin settings.
{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Bitbucket Cloud" %}}

_Available as of v2.2.0_

1. From the context menu, open the project for which you're configuring a pipeline.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Pipelines**.

1. Choose the **Use public Bitbucket Cloud** option.

1. Follow the directions displayed to **Setup a Bitbucket Cloud application**. Rancher redirects you to Bitbucket to setup an OAuth consumer in Bitbucket.

1. From Bitbucket, copy the consumer **Key** and **Secret**. Paste them into Rancher.

1. Click **Authenticate**.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "Bitbucket Server" %}}

_Available as of v2.2.0_

1. From the context menu, open the project for which you're configuring a pipeline.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Pipelines**.

1. Choose the **Use private Bitbucket Server setup** option.

1. Follow the directions displayed to **Setup a Bitbucket Server application**.

1. Enter the host address of your Bitbucket server installation.

1. Click **Authenticate**.

>**Note:**
> Bitbucket server needs to do SSL verification when sending webhooks to Rancher. Please ensure that Rancher server's certificate is trusted by the Bitbucket server. There are two options:
>
> 1. Setup Rancher server with a certificate from a trusted CA.
> 1. If you're using self-signed certificates, import Rancher server's certificate to the Bitbucket server. For instructions, see the Bitbucket server documentation for [configuring self-signed certificates](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/if-you-use-self-signed-certificates-938028692.html).

{{% /tabs %}}

**Result:** After the version control provider is authenticated, you will be automatically re-directed to start configuring which repositories that you want start using pipelines against. The list of repositories displayed are based on the user that setup the version control provider. Enable which repositories that you want to start using with a pipeline. Then click **Done**. You will be re-directed to the **Workloads > Pipelines** page and can start configuring your pipeline stages and steps.

#### Using Self-Signed-Certificate with Version Control Providers

If you want to use a version control provider with a certificate from a custom/internal CA root, the CA root certificates need to be added to the pipeline build pods. After configuring the version control provider, you will need to add the CA root certificate to the setting of the pipeline.

1. Follow the instructions to [configure your version control providers](#1-configuring-version-control-providers).

1. From the context menu, open the project for which you're configuring a pipeline.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Pipelines**.

1. Click **Edit cacerts**.

1. Paste in the CA root certificates and click **Save cacerts**.

**Result:** Pipelines can be used and will be able to work with the self-signed-certificate.

### 2. Configuring Pipeline Stages and Steps

Now that the pipeline is added to your project, you need to configure its automated stages and steps. For your convenience, there are multiple built-in step types for dedicated tasks.

1. From your project's **Pipeline** tab, find your new pipeline, and select **Ellipsis (...) > Edit Config**.

    >**Note:** When configuring a pipeline, it takes a few moments for Rancher to check for an existing pipeline configuration.

1. Select the **branch** you want to configure your pipeline for.

1. If you are not configuring your pipeline using a yaml file, i.e. `.rancher-pipeline.yml`, click **Configure pipeline for this branch**.

1. Add stages to your pipeline execution by clicking **Add Stage**. Select names for each stage of your pipeline.

1. After the stages are created, start adding steps to each stage by clicking **Add a Step**. You can add multiple steps to each stage.

    >**Note:** As you build out each stage and step, click `Show advanced options` to make [Advanced Configurations](#advanced-configuration), such as rules to trigger or skip pipeline actions, add environment variables, or inject environment variables using secrets. Advanced options are available the pipeline, each stage, and each individual step.

    **Step types available include:**

    {{% accordion id="clone" label="Clone" %}}

The first stage is preserved to be a cloning step that checks out source code from your repo. Rancher handles the cloning of the git repository. This action is equivalent to `git clone <repository_link> <workspace_dir>`.

    {{% /accordion %}}
    {{% accordion id="run-script" label="Run Script" %}}

The **Run Script** step executes arbitrary commands in the workspace inside a specified container. You can use it to build, test and do more, given whatever utilities the base image provides. For your convenience you can use variables to refer to metadata of a pipeline execution. Please go to the [Pipeline Variable Reference]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/reference/#variable-substitution) for the list of available variables.

1. From the **Step Type** drop-down, choose **Build and Publish**.

1. Fill in the rest of the form. Descriptions for each field are listed below. When you're done, click **Add**.

    Field | Description |
    ---------|----------|
     Dockerfile Path | The relative path to the Dockerfile in the source code repo. By default, this path is `./Dockerfile`, which assumes the Dockerfile is in the root directory. You can set it to other paths in different use cases (`./path/to/myDockerfile` for example). |
     Image Name | The image name in `name:tag` format. The registry address is not required. For example, to build  `example.com/repo/my-image:dev`, enter `repo/my-image:dev`. |
     Push image to remote repository | An option to set the registry that publishes the image that's built.  To use this option, enable it and choose a registry from the drop-down. If this option is disabled, the image is pushed to the internal registry. |
     Build Context <br/><br/> (**Show advanced options**)| By default, the root directory of the source code (`.`). For more details, see the Docker [build command documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).

{{% accordion id="publish-catalog-template" label="Publish Catalog Template" %}}

_Available as of v2.2.0_

The **Publish Catalog Template** step publishes a version of a catalog app template (i.e. Helm chart) to a [git hosted chart repository]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/catalog/custom/). It generates a git commit and pushes it to your chart repository. This process requires a chart folder in your source code's repository and a pre-configured secret in the dedicated pipeline namespace to complete successfully. [Pipeline variable substitution]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/reference/) is supported for any file in the chart folder.

1. From the **Step Type** drop-down, choose **Publish Catalog Template**.

1. Fill in the rest of the form. Descriptions for each field are listed below. When you're done, click **Add**.

    Field | Description |
    ---------|----------|
     Chart Folder | The relative path to the chart folder in the source code repo, where the `Chart.yaml` file is located. |
     Catalog Template Name | The name of the template. For example, wordpress. |
     Catalog Template Version | The version of the template you want to publish, it should be consistent with the version defined in the `Chart.yaml` file. |
     Protocol | You can choose to publish via HTTP(S) or SSH protocol. |
     Secret   | The secret that stores your Git credentials. You need to create a secret in dedicated pipeline namespace in the project before adding this step. If you use HTTP(S) protocol, store Git username and password in `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` key of the secret. If you use SSH protocol, store Git deploy key in `DEPLOY_KEY` key of the secret. After the secret is created, select it in this option. |
     Git URL  | The Git URL of the chart repository that the template will be published to. |
     Git Branch | The Git branch of the chart repository that the template will be published to. |
     Author Name | The author name used in the commit message. |
     Author Email | The author email used in the commit message. |


{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "By YAML" %}}

You can add **Publish Catalog Template** steps directly in the `.rancher-pipeline.yml` file.

Under the `steps` section, add a step with `publishCatalogConfig`. You will provide the following information:


* Path: The relative path to the chart folder in the source code repo, where the `Chart.yaml` file is located.
* CatalogTemplate: The name of the template.
* Version: The version of the template you want to publish, it should be consistent with the version defined in the `Chart.yaml` file.
* GitUrl: The git URL of the chart repository that the template will be published to.
* GitBranch: The git branch of the chart repository that the template will be published to.
* GitAuthor: The author name used in the commit message.
* GitEmail: The author email used in the commit message.
* Credentials: You should provide Git credentials by referencing secrets in dedicated pipeline namespace. If you publish via SSH protocol, inject your deploy key to the `DEPLOY_KEY` environment variable. If you publish via HTTP(S) protolcol, inject your username and password to `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` environment variables.

```yaml
# example
stages:
- name: Publish Wordpress Template
  steps:
  - publishCatalogConfig:
      path: ./charts/wordpress/latest
      catalogTemplate: wordpress
      version: ${CICD_GIT_TAG}
      gitUrl: git@github.com:myrepo/charts.git
      gitBranch: master
      gitAuthor: example-user
      gitEmail: user@example.com
    envFrom:
    - sourceName: publish-keys
      sourceKey: DEPLOY_KEY
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabs %}}

{{% /accordion %}}
{{% accordion id="deploy-yaml" label="Deploy YAML" %}}

This step deploys arbitrary Kubernetes resources to the project. This deployment requires a Kubernetes manifest file to be present in the source code repository. Pipeline variable substitution is supported in the manifest file. You can view an example file at [GitHub](https://github.com/rancher/pipeline-example-go/blob/master/deployment.yaml). For available variables, refer to [Pipeline Variable Reference]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/reference/).

1. When you're finished adding stages and steps, click **Done.**

### 3. Running the Pipeline

Run your pipeline for the first time. From the **Pipeline** tab, find your pipeline and select **Ellipsis (...) > Run**.

During this initial run, your pipeline is tested, and the following [pipeline components]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/) are deployed to your project as workloads in a new namespace dedicated to the pipeline:

- `docker-registry`
- `jenkins`
- `minio`

This process takes several minutes. When it completes, you can view each pipeline component from the project **Workloads** tab.

### 4. Configuring Persistent Data for Pipeline Components

The internal [Docker registry]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/#reg) and the [Minio]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/pipelines/#minio) workloads use ephemeral volumes by default. This default storage works out-of-the-box and makes testing easy, but you lose the build images and build logs if the node running the Docker Registry or Minio fails. In most cases this is fine. If you want build images and logs to survive node failures, you can configure the Docker Registry and Minio to use persistent volumes.

Complete both [A—Configuring Persistent Data for Docker Registry](#a—configuring-persistent-data-for-docker-registry) _and_ [B—Configuring Persistent Data for Minio](#b—configuring-persistent-data-for-minio).

>**Prerequisites (for both parts A and B):**
>
>[Persistent volumes]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/volumes-and-storage/#persistent-volumes) must be available for the cluster.

## Advanced Configuration

During the process of configuring a pipeline, you can configure advanced options for triggering the pipeline or configuring environment variables.

- [Configuring Pipeline Trigger Rules](#configuring-pipeline-trigger-rules)
- [Configuring Notifications](#configuring-notifications)
- [Configuring Timeouts](#configuring-timeouts)
- [Configuring Environment Variables](#configuring-environment-variables)
- [Configuring Pipeline Secrets](#configuring-pipeline-secrets)
- [Configuring the Executor Quota](#configuring-the-executor-quota)
- [Configuring the Compute Resources](#configuring-the-compute-resources)

### Configuring Pipeline Trigger Rules

When a repository is enabled, a webhook for it is automatically set in the version control system. By default, the project pipeline is triggered by a push event to a specific repository, but you can add (or change) events that trigger a build, such as a pull request or a tagging. When an event type is disabled, pipeline executions will not be triggered by the wehook of that event type.

To change trigger rules for a repository:

1. From the context menu, open the project for which you’ve configured a pipeline. Then select the Pipelines tab.

1. From the pipeline for which you want to change the trigger rules, select **Ellipsis (...) > Setting**.

1. Click on the check box to enable/disable triggering for **Push**, **Pull Request** or **Tag** event.

1. Click **Save**.

You can also set trigger rules to have fine-grained control of pipeline executions in pipeline configurations. Trigger rules come in two types:

- **Run this when:**

    This type of rule starts the pipeline, stage, or step when a trigger explicitly occurs.

- **Do Not Run this when:**

    This type of rule skips the pipeline, stage, or step when a trigger explicitly occurs.

If all conditions evaluate to true, then the pipeline/stage/step is executed. Otherwise it is skipped. When a pipeline is skipped, no execution will be triggered. When a stage/step is skipped, it is considered successful and follow-up stages/steps continue to run. Wildcard character (`*`) expansion is supported in conditions.

### Configuring Notifications

_Available as of v2.2.0_

You can configure pipelines to send out notifications to any [notifiers]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/notifiers-and-alerts/#notifiers) based on the build status of a pipeline. Before configuring a notification, Rancher recommends [setting up notifiers]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/notifiers-and-alerts/#adding-notifiers) so it will be easy to add recipients immediately.

> **Note:** Notifiers are configured at a cluster level, but pipeline notifications are configured at the project level.

1. Within the **Notification** section, turn on notifications by clicking **Enable**.

1. Select the conditions for the notification. You can select to get a notification for the following statuses: `Failed`, `Success`, `Changed`. For example, if you want to receive notifications when an execution fails, select **Failed**.

1. If you don't have any existing [notifiers]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/notifiers-and-alerts/#notifiers), Rancher will provide a warning that no notifers are set up and provide a link to be able to go to the notifiers page. Follow the [instructions]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/tools/notifiers-and-alerts/#adding-notifiers) to add a notifier. If you  already have notifiers, you can add them to the notification by clicking the **Add Recipient** button.

1. For each recipient, select which notifier type from the dropdown. Based on the type of notifier, you can use the default recipient or override the recipient with a different one. For example, if you have a notifier for Slack, you can update which channel to send the notification to. You can add additional notifiers by clicking **Add Recipient**.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "By YAML" %}}

You can add notifiers directly in the `.rancher-pipeline.yml` file.

Under the `notification` section, you will provide the following information:


* **Recipients:** This will be the list of notifiers/recipients that will receive the notification.
  * **Notifier:** The ID of the notifier. This can be found by finding the notifier and selecting **View in API** to get the ID.
  * **Recipient:** Depending on the type of the notifier, the "default recipient" can be used or you can override this with a different recipient. For example, when configuring a slack notifier, you select a channel as your default recipient, but if you wanted to send notifications to a different channel, you can select a different recipient.
* **Condition:** Select which conditions of when you want the notification to be sent.
* **Message (Optional):** If you want to change the default notification message, you can edit this in the yaml. Note: This option is not available in the UI.  

```yaml
# Example
stages:
  - name: Build something
    steps:
    - runScriptConfig:
        image: busybox
        shellScript: ls
notification:
  recipients:
  - # Recipient
    recipient: "#mychannel"
    # ID of Notifier
    notifier: "c-wdcsr:n-c9pg7"
  - recipient: "test@example.com"
    notifier: "c-wdcsr:n-lkrhd"
  # Select which statuses you want the notification to be sent  
  condition: ["Failed", "Success", "Changed"]
  # Ability to override the default message (Optional)
  message: "my-message"
```

### Configuring Timeouts

Each pipeline execution has a default timeout of 60 minutes. If the pipeline execution cannot complete within its timeout period, the pipeline is aborted. If a pipeline has more executions than can be completed in 60 minutes,

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "By UI" %}}
1. From the context menu, open the project for which you've configured a pipeline. Then select the **Pipelines** tab.

1. From the pipeline for which you want to edit the timeout, select **Ellipsis (...) > Edit Config**.

1. Click **Show advanced options**.  

1. Enter a new value in the **Timeout** field.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "By YAML" %}}
```yaml
# example
stages:
  - name: Build something
    steps:
    - runScriptConfig:
        image: busybox
        shellScript: ls
timeout: 30
```
{{% /tab %}}

### Configuring Environment Variables

When configuring a pipeline, you can use environment variables to configure the step's script.

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "By UI" %}}
1. From the context menu, open the project for which you've configured a pipeline. Then select the **Pipelines** tab.

1. From the pipeline in which you want to use environment variables, select **Ellipsis (...) > Edit Config**.

1. Click the  **Edit** icon for the step in which you want to use environment variables.

1. Click **Show advanced options**.  

1. Click **Add Variable**, and then enter a key and value in the fields that appear. Add more variables if needed.

1. Edit the script, adding your environment variable(s).

1. Click **Save**.

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab "By YAML" %}}
```yaml
# example
stages:
  - name: Build something
    steps:
    - runScriptConfig:
        image: busybox
        shellScript: echo ${FIRST_KEY} && echo ${SECOND_KEY}
      env:
        FIRST_KEY: VALUE
        SECOND_KEY: VALUE2
```
{{% /tab %}}

{{% /tabs %}}

### Configuring Pipeline Secrets

If you need to use security-sensitive information in your pipeline scripts (like a password), you can pass them in using Kubernetes [secrets]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/k8s-in-rancher/secrets/).

>**Prerequisite:** Create a secret for your project for use in pipelines.

>**Note:** Secret injection is disabled on pull request events.

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "By UI" %}}
1. From the context menu, open the project for which you've configured a pipeline. Then select the **Pipelines** tab.

1. From the pipeline in which you want to use environment variables, select **Ellipsis (...) > Edit Config**.

1. Click the  **Edit** icon for the step in which you want to use environment variables.

1. Click **Show advanced options**.  

1. Click **Add From Secret**. Select the secret file that you want to use. Then choose a key. Optionally, you can enter an alias for the key.

1. Click **Save**.

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab "By YAML" %}}
```yaml
# example
stages:
  - name: Build something
    steps:
    - runScriptConfig:
        image: busybox
        shellScript: echo ${ALIAS_ENV}
      # environment variables from project secrets
      envFrom:
      - sourceName: my-secret
        sourceKey: secret-key
        targetKey: ALIAS_ENV
```
{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}

### Configuring the Executor Quota

The _executor quota_ decides how many builds can run simultaneously in the project. If the number of triggered builds exceeds the quota, subsequent builds will queue until a vacancy opens. By default, the quota is `2`, but you can change it.

1. From the context menu, open the project for which you've configured a pipeline.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Pipelines**.

1. From `The maximum number of pipeline executors` increment the **Scale** up or down to change the quota. A value of `0` or less removes the quota limit.

### Configuring the Compute Resources

When a pipeline execution is triggered, a build pod is dynamically provisioned to run your CI tasks. Under the hood, A build pod consists of one Jenkins agent container and one container for each pipeline step. You can [manage compute resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/) for every containers in the pod.

To configure compute resources for Jenkins agent containers:

1. From the context menu, open the project for which you've configured a pipeline.

1. From the main menu, select **Tools > Pipelines**.

1. From `Configure the resource limit and reservation for executors` edit the **Memory Reservation**, **Memory Limit**, **CPU Reservation** or **CPU Limit**, then click **Update Limit and Reservation**.

To configure compute resources for pipeline-step containers:
{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "By YAML" %}}

You can configure compute resources for pipeline-step containers in the `.rancher-pipeline.yml` file.

Under a `step` section, you will provide the following information:

* CpuRequest: CPU request for the container of a pipeline step.
* CpuLimit: CPU limit for the container of a pipeline step.
* MemoryRequest: Memory request for the container of a pipeline step.
* MemoryLimit: Memory limit for the container of a pipeline step.

```yaml
# example
stages:
  - name: Build something
    steps:
    - runScriptConfig:
        image: busybox
        shellScript: ls
      cpuRequest: 100m
      cpuLimit: 1
      memoryRequest:100Mi
      memoryLimit: 1Gi
    - publishImageConfig:
        dockerfilePath: ./Dockerfile
        buildContext: .
        tag: repo/app:v1
      cpuRequest: 100m
      cpuLimit: 1
      memoryRequest:100Mi
      memoryLimit: 1Gi
```

>**Note:** Rancher sets default compute resources for pipeline steps except for `Build and Publish Images` and `Run Script` steps. You can override the default value by specifying compute resources in the same way.
