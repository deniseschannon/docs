### Upgrading Rancher

- [Upgrades]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/upgrades/)

### Rolling Back Unsuccessful Upgrades

In the event that your Rancher Server does not upgrade successfully, you can rollback to your installation prior to upgrade:

- [Single-Node Rollbacks]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/single-node-rollbacks)
- [High-Availability Rollbacks]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/ha-server-rollbacks)

> **Note:** If you are rolling back to versions in either of these scenarios, you must follow some extra [instructions]({{< baseurl >}}/rancher/v2.x/en/upgrades/rollbacks/) in order to get your clusters working.
>
>- Rolling back from v2.1.6+ to any version between v2.1.0 - v2.1.5 or v2.0.0 - v2.0.10.
>- Rolling back from v2.0.11+ to any version between v2.0.0 - v2.0.10.
